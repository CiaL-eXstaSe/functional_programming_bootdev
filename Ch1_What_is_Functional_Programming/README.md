CHAPTER 1: WHAT IS FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING?

===================
Learning Objectives
===================
- Understanding the fundamentals of Functional Programming (FP)
- Learning about immutability and its benefits
- Implementing pure functions and function composition
- Working with immutable data structures
- Understanding the difference between imperative and functional approaches
- Building a document conversion tool (Doc2Doc) using FP principles
- Mastering string manipulation in a functional way

=====
Notes
=====
- FP is a programming paradigm that emphasizes function composition over state mutation
- Immutable data structures prevent unexpected changes and make code more predictable
- Pure functions have no side effects and always return the same output for the same input
- Function composition allows building complex operations from simple functions
- Tuples are immutable while lists are mutable in Python
- FP focuses on "what" needs to be done rather than "how" to do it
- String manipulation in FP should avoid modifying strings in place
- The Doc2Doc project demonstrates practical applications of FP concepts
- FP principles lead to more maintainable and testable code
- Understanding the trade-offs between mutable and immutable data structures
